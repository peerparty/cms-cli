# P2EE CMS

The p2ee CMS is a decentralized content management system (CMS) built on [dat](https://datproject.org/), [hyperdb](https://github.com/mafintosh/hyperdb), and [signalhub](https://github.com/mafintosh/signalhub).

## Serverless

No more servers and hosting, no more databases, and ultimately alleviating the need for devops.  The goal of the p2ee CMS is to do away with all the work of server infrastructure and boilerplate.

## Markdown

Create a website simply by writing [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown), a simple text based layout language.
